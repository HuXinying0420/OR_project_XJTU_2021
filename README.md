## Project Overview

This project is a major assignment for the Operations Research course at Xi'an Jiaotong University, aiming to solve an investment portfolio optimization problem. Specifically, we need to design an optimal investment plan for a fund management company.

## Topic Description

A fund management company has 100 million yuan to invest in the stock market. Assume that 10 stocks are selected from the 50 constituent stocks of the SSE 50 for investment. The standard deviation of the daily closing price in September 2019 is used as a risk measure, and the increase from August 30 to September 30 is used as the expected return. Our task is to design the optimal investment plan, deciding how much to invest in each of the 10 selected stocks.

## Our Work

Decision-making for an investment portfolio is a crucial issue in modern finance. To study the 100 million yuan investment plan for a fund management company, this paper first considers objectives, constraints, and risk coefficients to establish an investment portfolio optimization model. Subsequently, Matlab is used for preprocessing the data of the 50 constituent stocks of the SSE 50, calculating the correlation coefficients and covariance values between the stocks. Then, the known conditions are substituted into the optimization model, and Python is used to solve the problem. The optimal investment portfolio plan is selected by comprehensively considering returns and risk coefficients from the optimization model results.

The specific code can be found in the [`Code`](./Code) folder.

## Project Structure

- `Brief` folder: Contains the specific requirements of the course group assignment.
- `Ref` folder: Contains data related to the SSE 50 constituent stocks.
- `Code` folder: Contains the specific code implementing the above optimization process.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Languages: Python, Matlab
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Optimization Algorithms: Operations research optimization methods



## Project Highlights

- Uses actual stock data for investment portfolio optimization.
- Considers both risk and expected returns.
- Provides detailed analysis reports and optimization results.

## Current Status

The project is completed, including full code, data, and analysis reports.

## 投资组合问题
某基金管理公司现有10000万元用于投资股市。假设在上证50的50支成分股中选择10种股票进行投资，以2019年9月间每种股票的日收盘价标准差作为风险度量，以8月30日至9月30日的涨幅作为预期收益。请为该基金公司设计最优投资方案（选出的10种股票的分别投资多少万元。
